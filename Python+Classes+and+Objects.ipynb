    "Python is an object oriented programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Class\n",
    "To create a class, use the keyword class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "  x = 5\n",
    "Create Object\n",
    "Now we can use the class named myClass to create objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:\n",
    "\n",
    "p1 = MyClass()\n",
    "print(p1.x)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__() Function\n",
    "The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Create a class named Person, use the __init__() function to assign values for name and age:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "p1 = Person(\"John\", 36)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(p1.name)\n",
    "print(p1.age)\n",
    "Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Methods\n",
    "Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belongs to the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us create a method in the Person class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:\n",

    "p1 = Person(\"John\", 36)\n",
    "p1.myfunc()\n",
    "Note: The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self Parameter\n",
    "The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",

    "# Access Modifiers in Python\n",
    "In most of the object-oriented languages access modifiers are used to limit the access to the variables and functions of a class. Most of the languages use three types of access modifiers, they are - private, public and protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like any other object oriented programming language, access to variables or functions can also be limited in python using the access modifiers. Python makes the use of underscores to specify the access modifier for a specific data member and member function in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access modifiers play an important role to protect the data from unauthorized access as well as protecting it from getting manipulated. When inheritance is implemented there is a huge risk for the data to get destroyed(manipulated) due to transfer of unwanted data from the parent class to the child class. Therefore, it is very important to provide the right access modifiers for different data members and member functions depending upon the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python: Types of Access Modifiers\n",
    "There are 3 types of access modifiers for a class in Python. These access modifiers define how the members of the class can be accessed. Of course, any member of a class is accessible inside any member function of that same class. Moving ahead to the type of access modifiers, they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Modifier: Public\n",
    "The members declared as Public are accessible from outside the Class through an object of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Modifier: Protected\n",
    "The members declared as Protected are accessible from outside the class but only in a class derived from it that is in the child or subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Modifier: Private\n",
    "These members are only accessible from within the class. No outside Access is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time for some Examples\n",
    "In this section we will provide some basic code examples for each type of access modifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "public Access Modifier\n",
    "By default, all the variables and member functions of a class are public in a python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# defining a class Employee\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    # constructor\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, sal):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.sal = sal\n",
    "All the member variables of the class in the above code will be by default public, hence we can access them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> emp = Employee(\"Ironman\", 999000)\n",
    ">>> emp.sal\n",
    "999000\n",
    "protected Access Modifier\n",
    "According to Python convention adding a prefix _(single underscore) to a variable name makes it protected. Yes, no additional keyword required.\n",
    "\n",
    "# defining a class Employee\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    # constructor\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, sal):\n",
    "        self._name = name   # protected attribute \n",
    "        self._sal = sal     # protected attribute\n",
    "In the code above we have made the class variables name and sal protected by adding an _(underscore) as a prefix, so now we can access them as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    ">>> emp = Employee(\"Captain\", 10000)\n",
    ">>> emp._sal\n",
    "10000\n",
    "Similarly if there is a child class extending the class Employee then it can also access the protected member variables of the class Employee. Let's have an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# defining a child class\n",
    "class HR(Employee):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # member function task\n",
    "    def task(self):\n",
    "        print \"We manage Employees\"\n",
    "Now let's try to access protected member variable of class Employee from the class HR:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> hrEmp = HR(\"Captain\", 10000)\n",
    ">>> hrEmp._sal\n",
    "10000\n",
    ">>> hrEmp.task()\n",
    "We manage Employees\n",
    "private Access Modifier\n",
    "While the addition of prefix __(double underscore) results in a member variable or function becoming private.\n",
    "\n",
    "# defining class Employee\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, sal):\n",
    "        self.__name = name    # private attribute \n",
    "        self.__sal = sal      # private attribute\n",
    "If we want to access the private member variable, we will get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> emp = Employee(\"Bill\", 10000)\n",
    ">>> emp.__sal\n",
    "\n",
    "AttributeError: 'employee' object has no attribute '__sal'\n",
    "\n",
    "All in one Example\n",
    "Now that we have seen each access modifier in separate examples, now let's combine all that we have learned till now in one example:\n",
