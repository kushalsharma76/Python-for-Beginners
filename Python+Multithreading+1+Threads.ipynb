    "# Multithreading \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like multiprocessing, multithreading is a way of achieving multitasking. In multithreading, the concept of threads is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first understand the concept of thread in computer architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Any process has 3 basic components:\n",
    "\n",
    "An executable program.\n",
    "The associated data needed by the program (variables, work space, buffers, etc.)\n",
    "The execution context of the program (State of process)\n",
    "A thread is an entity within a process that can be scheduled for execution. Also, it is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS (Operating System).\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple words, a thread is a sequence of such instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code. For simplicity, you can assume that a thread is simply a subset of a process!\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread contains all this information in a Thread Control Block (TCB):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Thread Identifier: Unique id (TID) is assigned to every new thread\n",
    "Stack pointer: Points to thread’s stack in the process. Stack contains the local variables under thread’s scope.\n",
    "Program counter: a register which stores the address of the instruction currently being executed by thread.\n",
    "Thread state: can be running, ready, waiting, start or done.\n",
    "Thread’s register set: registers assigned to thread for computations.\n",
    "Parent process Pointer: A pointer to the Process control block (PCB) of the process that the thread lives on.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a simple, single-core CPU, it is achieved using frequent switching between threads. This is termed as context switching. In context switching, the state of a thread is saved and state of another thread is loaded whenever any interrupt (due to I/O or manually set) takes place. Context switching takes place so frequently that all the threads appear to be running parallely (this is termed as multitasking).\n",

    "This method call enables a fast and efficient way to create new threads in both Linux and Windows.\n",
